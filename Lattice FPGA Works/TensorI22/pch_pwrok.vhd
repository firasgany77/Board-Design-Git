-- SLP_S3# asserted with or before PCH_PWROK
-- PCH_PWROK is derived from PG of the CPU's VR, with a delay at rising edge after SLP_S3# deassertion of minimum 1 msec (actual 3 msec).
   -- Firas Added: tPLT04: ALL_SYS_PWRGD assertion to PCH_PWROK. This timing must be controlled on the platform.[1 msec]
   -- Firas Added: PCH can delay de-assertion of PLTRST# with a soft strap setting. Refer tPCH08 and tPCH09 and the SPI Programming Guide for more details.
   -- Firas Added: PCH_PWROK assertion assumes all the following CPU and PCH voltage rails are ramped and stable except for: VCC, VCCGT, VCCGTx, VCCOPC, VCCEOPIO
  
-- VCCST_PWRGD is tied to PCH_PWROK, and should have a hardware resistive divider, to be at 1V domain (CPU input).
-- SLP_S3# assertion to VCCST_PWRGD de-assertion: maximum of 1 usec.
-- VR_VSA_READY is a signal to EC. in the CRB it is connected to VR_READY.

-- Firas Added:
-- VCCST_PWRGD can assert before or equal to PCH_PWROK, but must never lag it. 

-- It is recommended that both VCCST_PWRGD and PCH_PWROK include ALL_SYS_PWRGD and / or SLP_S3# in their generation. 
-- This ensures during failure events, both signals de-assert at the same time
-- VCCST_PWRGD signal must deassert in all Sx / DSx states, regardless of the status of the VCCST rail

-- PCH_PWROK: 
-- When asserted, PCH_PWROK indicates that all the main PCH Primary rails and all the CPU rails are up.
-- ALL_SYS_PWRGD assertion to SYS_PWROK.
-- This timing must be controlled on the platform. 
-- SYS_PWROK provides a platform/EC mechanism to stall the PCH de-assertion of PLTRST# to the platform.
-- Different platform components may have difference timing requirements from when their power rails are stable until their 
-- respective reset signal can de-assert. Platform designer should adjust this timing based on their specific platform requirements.


-- SYS_PWROK:
-- Generic power good input to the PCH is driven and utilized in a 
-- platform-specific manner. Informs PCH that power is stable to some
-- other system component(s) and the system is ready to start the exit from reset (de-asserts PLT_RST# to the processor).
-- Note: PCH_PWROK and SYS_PWROK both needs to be high to exit reset, but either signal can come up first. 
-- PCH does not monitor SYS_PWROK until after PCH_PWROK is asserted. 
-- SYS_PWROK may be tied to PCH_PWROK if the platform does not need the use of SYS_PWROK.


-- DDR_VTT_CTL: 
-- System Memory Power Gate Control: When signal is high â€“ platform memory VTT regulator is enable, output high.
-- When signal is low - Disables the platform memory VTT regulator in C8 and deeper and S3.
-- will start to go high on VDDQ ramp with VCCT_PWRGD low for Sx to S0 power state transitions. 
-- VccST_PWRGD assertion to DDR_VTT_CNTL asserted (Controlled by CPU, MAX: 100ns)
