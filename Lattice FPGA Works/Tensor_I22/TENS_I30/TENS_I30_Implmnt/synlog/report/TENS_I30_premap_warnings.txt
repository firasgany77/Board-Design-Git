@W: MT529 :"c:\users\firas.abdelghani\dropbox\board-design\fpga\lattice\projects\tensor_i22\source\pwrbtn.vhd":26:2:26:3|Found inferred clock pwrbtn_block|clk_100k which controls 19 sequential elements including count[15:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
