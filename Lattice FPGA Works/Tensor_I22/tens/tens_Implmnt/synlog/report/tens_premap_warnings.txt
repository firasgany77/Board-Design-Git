@W: MT529 :"c:\users\firas\dropbox\board-design\board-design-git\lattice fpga works\tensor_i22\counter.vhd":33:3:33:4|Found inferred clock TOP|FPGA_OSC which controls 33 sequential elements including b2v_inst20.counter[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
